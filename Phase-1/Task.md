## 1. Evaluate the measure of central tendency for the whole data followed by the simple random sample , stratified random sample , cluster sample and systematic sample.

## 2. Compare the means of all the different types of sample.

## 3. Finally, conclude which specific sampling technique mean value is almost similar to the population mean value. 

## 4. Use the [population Survey Data](Population_Survey_Data_lyst1750274390196.csv)

## completed

## 5. why in the sample data when we evaluate the standard deviation or variance we divide the factor by n-1

## 6. probability Distribution --> Kurtosis: Measures the tailesness of the data distribution. --> create a blog

## 7. Use case: Evaluate the kurtosis of the portfolio returns over the past year and what does that signify. and, you have to do the implementation corresponding to it.

## 8. Add a few samples in such way that it will become postive kurtosis
